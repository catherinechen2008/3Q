      Jellyfish are amazing Sea animals. Here are some facts about them:
    1.  Many jellyfish have bioluminescent organs, which emit
    light. This light may help them in a number of different ways, like
  attracting prey or distracting predators.
    2.  If a jellyfish is cut in two, the pieces of the jellyfish
    can regenerate and create two new organisms. Similarly, if
    a jellyfish is injured, it may clone itself and potentially
    produce hundreds of offspring.
    3.  There are two phases to jelly life: the stationary polyp
    stage and themobile medusa phase. It's the medusa phase that
     we're usually referring to
    when we talk about jellyfish. Typically, jellies start as polyps
     and develop into medusas, but the Turritopsis nutricula
      has earned it the nickname "the immortal jellyfish" for having
      the ability to travel backward to the polyp
       stage in times of stress.
